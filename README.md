# CureIt

## This is a Stress Management and counseling web application, designed specifically for college- going students mainly 18 years and above.

## Users will interact with counsellors using a chat room, called “Chat Me”, created as a webRTC based internal communication. No chats between clients and the counsellors will be stored. So this is completely going to be a safe space for users/victims/clients to share their thoughts and emotions. Users can even chat with other users too, anonymously by creating a separate chat room whose generated code will only be shared between them.
